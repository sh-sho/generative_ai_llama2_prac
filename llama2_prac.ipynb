Oracle Reports Builder is a tool that allows you to create reports from data stored in an Oracle database. It provides a graphical user interface for creating reports, which can be run.\\n\\nCreate a report in Oracle Reports Builder:\\n\\n1. Open Oracle Reports Builder:\\n\\nFirst, open the Oracle Reports Builder application. You can do this by navigating to the Start menu and selecting Oracle Reports Builder.\\n\\n2. Connect to a database:\\n\\nOnce Oracle Reports Builder is open, you will need to connect to a database. Click on the Connect button and enter the necessary information to connect to the database that contains the data you want to report on.\\n\\n3. Create a new report:\\n\\nAfter connecting to the database, click on the Create button to create a new report. Enter a name for the report and select a template.\\n\\n4. Add a table:\\n\\nTo add a table to the report, click on the Add Table button. Select the table that contains the data you want to report on and click OK.\\n\\n5. Drag and drop columns:\\n\\nOnce the table is added, you can drag and drop columns from the table onto the report. Click and drag a column header from the table pane on the left onto the report pane on the right.\\n\\n6. Customize the report:\\n\\nYou can customize the report by adding formulas, grouping data, and changing the layout. Click on a column header to access the Properties pane, where you can change the column's label, data format, and other properties.\\n\\n7. Preview the report:\\n\\nBefore running the report, you can preview it to make sure it looks the way you want. Click on the Preview button to see a sample of the report.\\n\\n8. Run the report:\\n\\nOnce you are satisfied with the report, click on the Run button to generate the report. The report will be displayed in a new window, and you can print it or save it as a PDF.\\n\\nAnd that's it! You've successfully created a simple report using Oracle Reports Builder. With more practice, you can create more complex reports and perform advanced functions like data manipulation, calculations, and data visualization.\"\n",

The database software sits at the center of many corporate IT environments, supporting a mix of transaction processing, business intelligence and analytics applications. In addition to its database offerings, Oracle sells a wide range of specialized software and hardware for enterprise IT environments, including middleware, application software, servers, storage and networking hardware, and tools for developing and deploying database applications.\n",

      "Oracle Database is available for deployment on premise in the data center, or in the cloud. The company also offers a cloud-based database service branded as Oracle Database Cloud Service. Oracle's database software is widely used in many industries, including telecommunications, financial services, insurance, healthcare and government. One of Oracle's strengths is its ability to handle large amounts of data and transactions, making it a favorite among large enterprises.\n",

      "The company's flagship product is Oracle Database, a relational database management system (RDBMS). Oracle Database is comprised of several components, including the Oracle Database Server, which manages database files; the Oracle SQL Developer, which is a tool for database development and management; and Oracle PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL), which is Oracle's proprietary extension of SQL used for stored procedures and other database programming. \n",

Much of Oracle's business model revolves around recurring revenue from ongoing subscriptions and support contracts, rather than one-time sales of its software and hardware products. The company has increasingly focused on cloud computing in recent years, introducing multiple cloud-based products and services designed to complement its legacy software and hardware offerings. \n",
